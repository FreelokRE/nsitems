# nsitems

All the weapon item files for my NS server. I run pre-beta NS so you should know that. Also, they are customized to my weapon base so you'll see shit like stat requirements. These wont work with your NS so remove them.

Installation is simple, drag and drop into your "weapons" folder in your schema. Feature colors, proper inventory icons, outlines, and pair to the custom SWEPs. Some of the fallout items are for some private SWEPs I've made so a few might not work but the grand majority will.
